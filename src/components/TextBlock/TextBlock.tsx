            <p className={styles.textBoxContent}>"Diplomacy, the art of the possible," has been one of the most flexible disciplines to adapt to new international realities. The art of making and conducting implements in international relations touches upon almost every aspect of human life, from war to the environment, from public health to human rights. But like other forms of making and conducting and means of making significant changes, like our very lives, diplomacy has its apogee and its crisis. And it is precisely in these moments of history when the interest and attention of public opinion in the conduct and in the role of diplomats are greater, as the most significant events regarding the activity of the profession of making significant changes must be set. The end of the Cold War established a less conflictive and more cooperative international context in which diplomacy and ambassadors should have performed a more intense and perfect action, but paradoxically, at that precise moment, the institution of ambassadors and the way of conducting practically disappeared from the 'Bond of time' without making a transformation process or significant reform in it. Diplomatic representations fell into disuse. The posts of ambassadors were not covered or were left to junior members of the profession who exercised with unbelievable irresponsibility. And as a consequence, the ways of making and conducting in 'Das Relações' lost the effectiveness, effectiveness, and prestige that they deserved, putting into question the very survival of the institution of the traditional embassy, having to adopt a new style or role, or transform itself into an institution on the way to extinction, so that fifteen years later, they have to emphasize in a reconversion and recuperation of the models of traditional organization of diplomacy.</p>
